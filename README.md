#### Overview  
This repository hosts the source code and deployment for my personal portfolio website, currently under construction.

The site is intended to evolve into a fully functional portfolio sometime in 2025, showcasing my work, skills, and accomplishments.

I use Git for version control to ensure systematic development and tracking of updates over time. Major features and fixes will be tagged with corresponding release versions.  

#### Deployment

Deployment is automated and managed through GitHub Pages.

The website is publicly accessible but still under development. Contributions are not currently accepted as it represents my personal portfolio.
